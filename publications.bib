	abstract = {Despite a high sucrose accumulation in its taproot vacuoles, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) is sensitive to freezing. Earlier, a taproot-specific accumulation of raffinose was shown to have beneficial effects on the freezing tolerance of the plant. However, synthesis of raffinose and other oligosaccharides of the raffinose family depends on the availability of myo-inositol. Since inositol and inositol-metabolising enzymes reside in different organelles, functional inositol metabolism and raffinose synthesis depend on inositol transporters. We identified five homologues of putative inositol transporters in the sugar beet genome, two of which, BvINT1;1 and BvINT1;2, are localised at the tonoplast. Among these, only the transcript of BvINT1;1 is highly upregulated in sugar beet taproots under cold. BvINT1;1 exhibits a high transport specificity for inositol and sugar beet mutants lacking functional BvINT1;1 contain increased inositol levels, likely accumulating in the vacuole, and decreased raffinose contents under cold treatment. Due to the quenching capacity of raffinose for Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which accumulate under cold stress, bvint1;1 sugar beet plants show increased expression of both, ROS marker genes and detoxifying enzymes. Based on these findings, we conclude that the vacuolar inositol transporter BvINT1;1 is contributing to ROS-homoeostasis in the cold metabolism of sugar beet.},

	abstract = {Adaptor protein complexes mediate cargo selection and vesicle trafficking to different cellular membranes in all eukaryotic cells. Information on the role of AP4 in plants is still limited. Here, we present the analyses of
              
                Arabidopsis thaliana
              
              mutants lacking different subunits of AP4. These mutants show abnormalities in their development and in protein sorting. We found that growth of roots and etiolated hypocotyls, as well as male fertility and trichome morphology are disturbed in
              ap4.
              Analyses of
              GFP‐
              fusions transiently expressed in mesophyll protoplasts demonstrated that the tonoplast (TP) proteins MOT2, NRAMP3 and NRAMP4, but not INT1, are partially sorted to the plasma membrane (PM) in the absence of a functional AP4 complex. Moreover, alanine mutagenesis revealed that in wild‐type plants, sorting of NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 to the TP requires an
              N
              ‐terminal dileucine‐based motif. The NRAMP3 or NRAMP4
              N
              ‐terminal domain containing the dileucine motif was sufficient to redirect the PM localized INT4 protein to the TP and to confer AP4‐dependency on sorting of INT1. Our data show that correct sorting of NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 depends on both, an
              N
              ‐terminal dileucine‐based motif as well as AP4.},
