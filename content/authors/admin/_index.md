      I captured the beautiful image that made it on the cover of The Plant Cell from a thin cross section of the root of a very young sugar beet on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope after staining with Calcofluor white and basic fuchsin. The article we contributed to the same issue demonstrate that young taproots ‚Äî which at this developmental stage represent the major carbohydrate sink of the plant ‚Äî will much later go through a major transition and will metamorphose to become a source of carbohydrates by translocating sucrose towards the shoot.

    summary: |
      Not only did I get to spend a week with two of the most awesome plant-loving PhD students, we also excited to meet an author of the paper (Ursache et al, 2018) that had triggered our histology-phase during which the Cover Figure above was born. After we had been told our posters sucked, the three of us returned with a suprisingly satisfactory feeling of triumph that came with the two awards we brought with us (one for the best microscopic image by one of the PhD students, and another for my poster titled "aINT no sorting when She's gone" - which made it among the "best scientific poster"s of the conference.)
