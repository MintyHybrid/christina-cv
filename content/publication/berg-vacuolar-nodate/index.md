abstract: Despite a high sucrose accumulation in its taproot vacuoles, sugar beet
  (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) is sensitive to freezing. Earlier, a taproot-specific
  accumulation of raffinose was shown to have beneficial effects on the freezing tolerance
  of the plant. However, synthesis of raffinose and other oligosaccharides of the
  raffinose family depends on the availability of myo-inositol. Since inositol and
  inositol-metabolising enzymes reside in different organelles, functional inositol
  metabolism and raffinose synthesis depend on inositol transporters. We identified
  five homologues of putative inositol transporters in the sugar beet genome, two
  of which, BvINT1;1 and BvINT1;2, are localised at the tonoplast. Among these, only
  the transcript of BvINT1;1 is highly upregulated in sugar beet taproots under cold.
  BvINT1;1 exhibits a high transport specificity for inositol and sugar beet mutants
  lacking functional BvINT1;1 contain increased inositol levels, likely accumulating
  in the vacuole, and decreased raffinose contents under cold treatment. Due to the
  quenching capacity of raffinose for Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which accumulate
  under cold stress, bvint1;1 sugar beet plants show increased expression of both,
  ROS marker genes and detoxifying enzymes. Based on these findings, we conclude that
  the vacuolar inositol transporter BvINT1;1 is contributing to ROS-homoeostasis in
  the cold metabolism of sugar beet.
