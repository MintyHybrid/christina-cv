abstract: Adaptor protein complexes mediate cargo selection and vesicle trafficking
  to different cellular membranes in all eukaryotic cells. Information on the role
  of AP4 in plants is still limited. Here, we present the analyses of  Arabidopsis
  thaliana  mutants lacking different subunits of AP4. These mutants show abnormalities
  in their development and in protein sorting. We found that growth of roots and etiolated
  hypocotyls, as well as male fertility and trichome morphology are disturbed in ap4.
  Analyses of GFP‐ fusions transiently expressed in mesophyll protoplasts demonstrated
  that the tonoplast (TP) proteins MOT2, NRAMP3 and NRAMP4, but not INT1, are partially
  sorted to the plasma membrane (PM) in the absence of a functional AP4 complex. Moreover,
  alanine mutagenesis revealed that in wild‐type plants, sorting of NRAMP3 and NRAMP4
  to the TP requires an N ‐terminal dileucine‐based motif. The NRAMP3 or NRAMP4 N
  ‐terminal domain containing the dileucine motif was sufficient to redirect the PM
  localized INT4 protein to the TP and to confer AP4‐dependency on sorting of INT1.
  Our data show that correct sorting of NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 depends on both, an N ‐terminal
  dileucine‐based motif as well as AP4.
