 abstract = {Adaptor protein complexes mediate cargo selection and vesicle trafficking to different cellular membranes in all eukaryotic cells. Information on the role of AP4 in plants is still limited. Here, we present the analyses of

Arabidopsis thaliana

mutants lacking different subunits of AP4. These mutants show abnormalities in their development and in protein sorting. We found that growth of roots and etiolated hypocotyls, as well as male fertility and trichome morphology are disturbed in
ap4.
Analyses of
GFP‐
fusions transiently expressed in mesophyll protoplasts demonstrated that the tonoplast (TP) proteins MOT2, NRAMP3 and NRAMP4, but not INT1, are partially sorted to the plasma membrane (PM) in the absence of a functional AP4 complex. Moreover, alanine mutagenesis revealed that in wild‐type plants, sorting of NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 to the TP requires an
N
‐terminal dileucine‐based motif. The NRAMP3 or NRAMP4
N
‐terminal domain containing the dileucine motif was sufficient to redirect the PM localized INT4 protein to the TP and to confer AP4‐dependency on sorting of INT1. Our data show that correct sorting of NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 depends on both, an
N
‐terminal dileucine‐based motif as well as AP4.},
